Unity Version Used: 2018.2.11f1

Folder marked "Playable" contains release build.
Folder marked "Code" contains unity project and code.

The game is supposed to be a multiplayer game, for testing purposes I changed the required player count to 1.
We had issues with cordination between artists and programmers, that's why the game doesn't look that great.
